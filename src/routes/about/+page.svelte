        <p class="text-white montserrat text-xl sm:text-xl font-normal">Friend A Labs started in 2022 when friends came together to discuss the lack of real consumer-focused applications in the blockchain industry.
             Our founder, Shin, has been toying with the idea of building a better alternative for digital asset marketplaces and advertising for years.
              With Friend A Labs, these ideas are becoming reality.

            <h2 class="font-extrabold text-xl brick-pink">Ship fast, then perfect it</h2>
            <p class="text-xl montserrat">Launch solid products fast, then work on ironing out small bugs and perfecting them using community feedback.</p>
                 <br />
                 <h2 class="font-extrabold text-xl brick-pink">Foster curiosity</h2>
            <p class="text-xl montserrat">Venturing off-topic often leads to very creative new approaches to existing challenges. We encourage team members to go down their respective rabbit holes, and apply what they learned later on.</p>
                 <br />
                 <h2 class="font-extrabold text-xl brick-pink">Balance working together and giving people space</h2>
            <p class="text-xl montserrat">We love catching up with each other, bouncing off ideas, and thinking through tough problems. But we also give each other space to work on parts individually because we understand that this is often where people get in the zone and deliver awesome results.</p>

                 <h2 class="font-extrabold text-xl brick-pink">Be a Friend A</h2>
            <p class="text-xl montserrat">That means being supportive, open-minded, and not shying away from big tasks. Overcome one's fears to empower others.</p>
